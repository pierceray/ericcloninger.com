Here you are! 

Perhaps you have my resume in hand and you've Googled me. Or you saw a link
to my **[online resume](http://portfolio.ericcloninger.com)** and you thought you'd try to 
figure out who the person behind the resume is. Perhaps you found my site by mistake and
you're just clicking links. It doesn't matter, I'm here to talk about me.

I started out writing software for money in the late 1980's. My first *real* coding job
came in 1988 and I was making $9/hour to write C programs to convert massive (at the time) text
files into a predecessor of HTML on a VAX.  Eventually, the company had me writing these
programs on PC and eventually Macintosh.

I found I loved writing Mac software and eventually had several jobs where that was my
primary responsibility. As a result, I know way too much about developing in Pascal. I don't
write Mac software any longer, as it doesn't really interest me enough to learn Xcode and
Objective C.
