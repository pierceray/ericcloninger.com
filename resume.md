Here you are! 

Perhaps you have my resume in hand and you've Googled me. Or you saw a link
to my **[online resume](http://portfolio.ericcloninger.com){:target="_blank"}** and you thought you'd try to 
figure out who the person behind the resume is. Perhaps you found my site by mistake and
you're just clicking links. It doesn't matter, I'm here to talk about me.

I started out writing software for money in the late 1980's. My first *real* coding job
came in 1988 and I was making $9/hour to write C programs to convert massive (at the time) text
files into a predecessor of HTML on a VAX.  From there to writing C code on Windows PCs and
Pascal on Macintosh.

Through the years, my skills evolved to writing C++ code on Windows NT and classic Macintosh.
In 1996, I went to work for a company in Austin, TX that changed the course of my career.
In addition to helping create a cool new type of development environment, I was leading
other developers in their work. That company was hired to create the software toolkit for 
a new type of computing device. You might not have heard of Metrowerks or the CodeWarrior 
development tools, but you've probably heard of the PalmPilot. Between Metrowerks and Palm 
itself, I worked on PDA tools and apps for eight fun years.

After Palm, I moved from leading teams of developers to working with groups outside the
engineering organization. Since 2006, I've almost exclusively worked as a Product Manager
on development tools. I work with Marketing, Sales, and customers to lead the engineering
teams on future releases. Having been a developer for 18 years, I bring my experience to
bridge the gap between technical and non-technical parties. There's a lot of cat herding 
involved in being a Product Manager, but I've enjoyed the role.

An aside to my work for the last 10 years is that I'm very experienced in working in and
with open source development teams. I've led teams where 100% of the work is devoted to
open source projects and other teams where open source was consumed to create a legal
derivative product. I'm experience working with different open source licenses and can
discuss the merits and problems with each.

I took a sabbatical from work in early 2016 after my wife passed away. I used the time to grieve
and help my children with their own grieving. As of Fall 2016, I'm ready to look for something
new and interesting.
