  <h3>Welcome to EricCloninger.com</h3>
  <p>This site is where I keep my personal blog posts as well as a historical record of the 
  blog posts, white papers, and presentations that I've created for my employers for the 
  last 15 years (or so).
  <p>I've begun hosting my own photos on this site as well. For many years, I kept photos
  on a variety of services like Flickr, SmugMug, and Picasa but I don't need anything 
  fancy--just a place where visitors can see my photos.
  <p>This site also contains an interactive version of my resume that was built using
  Bootstrap 3. You can access that site <a href="resume.html">by clicking here</a> or by
  using the navigation bar at the top. If you are looking for a printable copy of my
  resume, you can <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/resume/Eric_Cloninger_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">
  find it here</a>.
  <p>Thank you for stopping by.
