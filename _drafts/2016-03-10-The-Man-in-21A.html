<p>The man sits in seat 21A, staring blankly out the window as others board the plane. Lost in thought and distracted by the music in his ears, he barely notices the off-duty flight crew member who sits in 21C. Across the aisle, a group of retirees finds their seats and talk loudly of their cruise.

<p>The plane backs away from the gate and the crew member falls asleep with the ease of someone who has spent a lifetime of dozing upright. Out the window, he spots an Airbus 380, painted in the livery of Emirates Airlines. A conversation from the previous summer jumps forward in his memory.

<p><i>"France and England have been nice, but it's time for something different. Maybe Istanbul or Dubai. Then, Japan."</i> He agreed. It would be nice.

<p>The song changes as the Boeing 737-800 makes the turn onto runway 19C. Another memory jumps up. Then another. All of them. At once.

<p>As the plane accelerates and the nose begins to lift, the suppressed grief seizes the opportunity to escape. He lurches forward, as if to vomit, one short, audible gasp emerges as the waves of fear, guilt and loneliness bring spasms to his intestines. He clenches his mouth shut to contain the sobs as he shudders violently against his will. 

<p>The plane crosses through 10,000 ft as he regains control. His seatmate sleeps, ignorant to the emotional distress of the man in 21A.

<p>He turns toward the aisle, eyes red and puffy. The woman in the straw hat across the aisle waves at him and mouths a silent <i>"Are you OK?"</i>

<p>He holds up his right hand for her to see. The late winter sun beams through the window, highlighting the diamonds of a womans wedding band on his pinky. Her eyes catch the flicker of light and she understands. She silently says <i>"I'm so sorry"</i> as a tear finds its' way down her cheek. She looks out the window, accepting some of his grief as her own. Her husband snores in the seat beside her, blissfully unaware.

<p>He puts his sunglasses on and changes the music. Tears continue quietly as the pain in his gut subsides.  

<p>Deplaning in Chicago, once again he makes eye contact with the woman in the straw hat. Her eyes show evidence of her own silent grieving for a woman she never met. Her husband looks at her and then at the man in 21A. She gives him a look of "Don't ask" and 50 years of a shared life has trained him to keep quiet.

<p>The older couple turns left towards baggage claim. The man in 21A turns right and heads for his flight home. 

<p>Walking through the concourse, he manages a thin smile and nods at a young couple in t-shirts announcing that they are on their honeymoon. A memory returns. It's a beautiful day in a park, years ago with friends and family. 

<p>He remembers there is a straw hat at home on a hook, next to a pair of well-worn gardening shears. A memory returns of shopping for flowers in the spring. He gives himself permission to be happy again soon, knowing she would let him.
