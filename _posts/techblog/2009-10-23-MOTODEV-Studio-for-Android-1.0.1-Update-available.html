<p>Announcement: MOTODEV Studio for Android 1.0.1 Update available</p>
<p>10-23-2009 01:49 PM</p>

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>

<p>We've made an update to MOTODEV Studio for Android. We found a few bugs after we pushed the 1.0 installer live that we wish to fix. Also, with this being our 1.0 release, we wanted to test the update mechanism to ensure that it works to our satisfaction.
 <p><strong>Bugs Addressed</strong>
<p>The bugs we've addressed are:
<p>Application Name entered by the user was not being properly saved in the AndroidManifest.xml. This occurred for new projects not based on samples or existing source.
<p>When an update is performed that would cause an alert saying that Eclipse has to be restarted for the update to take effect was not displayed if the SDK installer had been executed on that same session. On next updates of Studio, the Eclipse alert should be displayed on any scenario.
<p>Fixed DataTools component version matching rule. This will prevent updates to the Eclipse DataTools component rendering the MOTODEV Database perspective inoperable.
<p><strong>Accessing the Update</strong>
<p>Before accessing the update, check a few things first. Go to "Window->Preferences->Install/Update->Available Software Sites" and ensure that there is a site named "MOTODEV Studio for Android Updates" and that it is enabled. Also, if you are working behind a proxy, you will need to enter the proxy information in the preference panel named "General->Network Connections".  Mac users, the Preferences screen is on the "MOTODEV Studio" menu. While in this preference screen, you should test your network connection by pressing the "Test Connection" button.
<p>To check for updates, choose "Help->Check for Updates".  The MOTODEV Studio update site uses the HTTPS protocol and requires a password, so you will need to supply your MOTODEV user name and password. Fortunately, if you have a secure machine, you need only enter this information once and choose the "Save Password" check box. When the update is ready, you will see it mentioned in the updates window.  The update is approximately 1MB in size and should not take more than a few moments to install.
<p><strong>P2 Updater Bug</strong>
<p>We've identified a problem in the Eclipse p2 updater and we are submitting a bug report covering it. If you get a message saying "Nothing to update, then you will need to use the following work-around:
<ol>
<li>Select "Window->Preferences->Install/Update->Available Software Sites"
<li>Choose the item named "MOTODEV Studio for Android Updates" and press the "Test Connection" button. This will clear the cache for the site and allow new updates to be downloaded.
<li>You should now be able to receive updates.  If you are still unsuccessful in receiving the update, go back to the dialog and modify the update site by appending a foward slash to the site URL.
 </ol>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ol>
<li>If you see a message about operations being blocked, do not be alarmed--this is the Eclipse update manager doing its work and the warning message is more severe than the condition. Give the update manager a minute or two in order to do its work and the updates should install properly.
<li>The dependency level between the MOTODEV Studio components and several Eclipse components (DTP, PDE) has changed with this update. If you've updated these Eclipse components in MOTODEV Studio separately, the 1.0.1 update may not install. If this occurs, you must uninstall MOTODEV Studio, reinstall, run the MOTODEV Studio update, and then update your Eclipse components. We apologize for the confusion, but we had the dependencies incorrect for these components in Studio 1.0. 
 </ol>
<p>Once you've installed the update, you will need to restart MOTODEV Studio. Voila!
 <p>If you have any problems with the update or other questions or comments about MOTODEV Studio for Android, please post your feedback in the MOTODEV Discussion boards.
 <p>Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio for Android.
