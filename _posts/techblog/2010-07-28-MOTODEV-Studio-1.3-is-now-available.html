This new release provides support for the Android 2.2 (Froyo) SDK and includes version 0.9.7 of the Google ADT plugins. For this release, we've added support for building C and C++ projects using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK), automatic discovery of SDK addons, improvements to the database view, new templated activity wizards, and a bunch of new code snippets for you to use in your own projects.</p>

		<p>Hello Everyone,
		<p>Now that the MOTODEV Studio team is focused again on software development (and not the FIFA World Cup), we are pleased to bring you MOTODEV Studio for Android version 1.3. This new version supports the Android 2.2 (Froyo) SDK and includes the ADT 0.9.7 plugins.
		<p>The release notes, installation guide, and installers are available on the MOTODEV Studio download site. Highlights of version 1.3 are as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>Build native apps using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK). This is a new feature and will probably change in subsequent releases, but we're excited to have it in this release. You will need to download, install, and configure the NDK manually before using this feature.
		<li>Use the database tool to open or create databases on your computer and inspect or modify them.
		<li>Generate database management classes for SQLite databases that are included in your projects. Create a database, include it as an asset in your project, get access to it using generated classes and share your data with other apps using the automated Content Provider wizard.
		<li>Analyze memory usage (search for memory leaks, reduce memory consumption) using MAT. Use the HPROF dump feature of DDMS to observe your apps' behavior and use MAT to collate and inspect the results.
		<li>Download and configure SDKs and platforms, SDK add-ons, samples, language packs, and NDKs all from a single dialog called "Download Components" (available on the MOTODEV menu).
		<li>Create and execute Monkey tests from the Device Manager view.
		<li>Create a variety of new activities based upon templates using the New Activity wizard such as a preferences dialog with a few clicks of the mouse or a scrolling list attached to a database.
		<li>Use code snippets for Bluetooth, SQL, Web and Web Services, Sensors, and General UI Utilities
		<li>Create widget projects and widget providers using new wizards
		<li>Connect to git code repositories with the eGit plugin
		</ul>
		<p>There are known issues with the release. We've documented them as best we can, with workarounds where we've found them. If you read nothing else (besides the install guide), please look at the known issues before posting your bug reports. It could be that we've already identified the problem and have a workaround.
		<p>One known issue that I'd like to highlight is for users of 64-bit Windows 7. Late in the testing cycle, we discovered that there are issues with the installer when you are running as a non-administrator. Please read the known issues for the workarounds for this problem. We have a solution that we're working on and will announce soon. In the future, we are working to have installers that operate correctly on 64-bit Windows 7 systems.
		<p>If you have any problems with the release, please post in the MOTODEV Studio Discussion board. We hope you enjoy what we've put together and we're interested in getting your feedback on what you like and what you'd like to see in a future release.
		<p>Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio for Android.
