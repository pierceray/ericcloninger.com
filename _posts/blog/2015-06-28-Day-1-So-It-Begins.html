<p>Well, it's time. More or less. The bags are packed and stowed in the back of my pickup.
We're only a few hours from departing on our 3 week trip to Europe. We're made arrangements 
with our friends, family and neighbors to feed the critters and watch the house. Here's a 
rundown of what we'll be doing and where you can find content to follow along.
<p><a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images{{ page.id }}/travel_map.png" target=_blank"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; " src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images{{ page.id }}/travel_map.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>
My mother says she has no idea where we're going. Even though she has a set of
encyclopedias in her home (and the Internet), she says all those countries have changed.
So here's a map (click to enlarge).
<p>First, we're heading to London, via Houston. The trip to London is on the new 787 
Dreamliner. This will be a first for me and I'm pretty excited to see what that plane
looks like. We're spending 6 days in London at an apartment on the south side of the 
Thames, near the Tower Bridge.
<p>On the 5th, we'll be taking the EuroStar train to Amsterdam, via Brussels. Beau wanted
to visit Amsterdam after reading the Anne Frank diary and watching a young-adult movie
that took place in Amsterdam. Jackie and I encouraged the kids to put in their ideas, as
it's their trip too.
<p>From Amsterdam, we're renting a car and driving. Not sure where. We haven't booked any
arrangements for the 4 days. We'll mosey about, perhaps heading toward Luxembourg or
perhaps visit some of the World War I and II battle sites and cemeteries. 
<p><a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images{{ page.id }}/geocache_eu.png" target=_blank"><img style="float:right; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; " 
src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images{{ page.id }}/geocache_eu.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>
My rationale for visiting Luxembourg is to find a <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/" target="_blank">Geocache</a> there. By the time we finish 
this trip, we will find Geocaches in Netherlands and Belgium. If I fail to find a geocache
there, I will have a hole in my caching map for the middle of Europe and that will drive
my particular brand of OCD crazy. 
<p>The Tour de France is going along the northern coast of France that week. While I 
would love to see le Tour in person, we watch the races every year and it seems the fans
along the country roads are a particular type of crazy. Perhaps some day, we'll see the 
peloton ride into Paris. As le Tour clears out of the Normandy area, perhaps we'll visit
the D-Day sites there.
<p>We arrive in Paris on July 11. We're staying only about half a mile (~1km) from the Eiffel
Tower, on the other side of the river. I'm interested to see how the French turn out for
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day">national holiday</a>. Do they 
kick back like Americans, or are they insane like the Canadians on Canada Day?
<p>We'll head home on July 17. No doubt tired and hopefully full of memories to last a
lifetime.
<p>The main place where we will post photos along the way will be my SmugMug account.
The password for the site is "Hydro".
