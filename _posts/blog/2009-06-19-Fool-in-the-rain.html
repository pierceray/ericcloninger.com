title: Fool in the rain
---


<p>Two of my top movies of all time are <a href=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/>The Shawshank Redemption</a> and <a href=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/>V for Vendetta</a>.  Both movies have a climactic scene where the protagonist finds themselves free from their torments.  In both cases, they find themselves outside their prison in the rain with thunder and lightning, with arms outstretched to the sky.  It's very powerful cinematography and I'm glad that more filmmakers <b>don't</b> use it, cheapening the impact.
<p>We're getting a bit of a rain shower with thunder this morning.  I was working when I remembered that my pickup windows were down.  I walked from my office in back of our property to the house and out to the driveway.  I let the warm spring rain land where it may&ndash;I had no intention of sheltering myself.  I haven't gone through trials that Andy Dufresne or Evey Hammond did in those movies, but I feel unburdened from a few extra worries.
<p>Or, it could be the fact that we're leaving on our vacation in about 6 hours&hellip;</p>
