title: Sixteen tons (of number 9 coal)
---


<p>For our upcoming trip to France, Jackie and I are trying to pack light. We're taking a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/747934">duffle bag </a>and a medium-sized backpack. She will also take a sling bag for moving about during the day. We're trying to keep the weight to under 45 pounds between the 2 of us in order to make moving between locations easier. I've allocated 60% of our pounds to my pack. </p>
<p>If you know me, you know I love to photograph things. Of the weight allowance, I'm allocating 8 pounds to camera gear. I hope I can get everything I need in that amount of weight. Jackie, on the other hand, is buying a new <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/583955-REG/Canon_2663B001_PowerShot_G10_Digital_Camera.html">Canon Powershot G10</a> camera, which has a lot of bells and whistles for something that will fit in a shirt pocket. I'm half tempted to just use the G10, but I know I would be miserable if I did. In addition to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pentax-10-2MP-Digital-Camera-Reduction/dp/B000IHN8AO">Pentax K10D</a>, I'm taking my <a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/camera-lenses/#11">two DA* zoom lenses</a>, which add significantly to the bottom line but they take exquisite photos. I'm debating whether to take my <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/439931-REG/Slik_613_338_Pro_340DX_Tripod_Black_.html">travel tripod</a> or just get by with the <a href="http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/slrzoom/">GorillaPod</a>. I know many of the locations around Paris won't let visitors use a tripod, but I want to get some sunrise and sunset photos and I'm more comfortable with a traditional tripod.</p>
<p>As for computer gear, I'm taking the <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/product900.html">Asus EEE netbook</a> that I bought last month. It weighs less than 2 pounds and has enough ooomph to do light work. We'll be able to get emails and post dispatches along the way, but I won't be editing photos until I get home. It's fine for looking at photos on the data card, watching movies, and reading email, but I wouldn't dream of trying to run Photoshop or Lightroom on it.</p>
<p>I will be taking a phone that makes calls. But, I will also be trying out an Android phone. I have the <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/447-android-g1-developer-phone/">Android Developer Phone </a>(ADP) that I will load with apps and guidebook info. I'm curious to see if I can travel as easy with the ADP as I could with my Treo or the Moto Q.</p>
<p>We will take the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=9316">Garmin Nuvi 270 </a>because it has European maps and can do turn-by-turn routing. It also has a pedestrian mode which should be useful in Paris. I will take the Garmin Vista Cx with European maps so we can do some light <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=3a952246-fd01-421f-adc6-ffc0abdf2cc9">Geocaching </a>along the way. I've found caches in France before, but we can add Switzerland to our list easily and Italy with a little bit of effort.</p>
<p>We both have our iPods. Mine has plenty of movies on it. I'm ripping season 1 of <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/home.do"><i>The Tudors</i> </a>to watch on the plane going over. Yes, I know Henry VIII was the English monarch, but I've been keen to watch that show for quite some time. I may also convert a couple of baseball games off the Tivo just for fun.  Of course, there are the old standby: Firefly, V for Vendetta, LOTR&hellip;  I bought a rechargeable battery pack for the iPod which will come in handy on the train and the planes.</p>
<p><i>But what about clothes</i>, you ask?  I have a good selection of travel clothing that is stylish and lightweight. I've removed cotton from my travel pack in favor of lightweight, moisture-wicking synthetics. I've said this before on this blog, but <a href="http://www.exofficio.com/">Ex-Officio </a>underwear is worth every cent.  Jackie doesn't have as much travel clothing, but after a visit to REI last weekend and some online purchases, she'll have what she needs.  We will pack 3-4 days of clothing and do laundry before we leave Provence for Paris.</p>
<p>Next up, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles!</p>
