<p>Antwerp is an attractive enough city, but it was raining again when we woke, so we
decided to pack and leave town. I wanted the kids to see some memorials to war (and the
futility thereof), so we set out for a two hour drive to the town of Bastogne.

<p>...

<p>While we drive, I'll talk about driving and navigating in Europe. You can skip down if
you'd rather not here a map nerd talk about maps.

<p>It's hard to
understand how difficult it is as an American to drive here unless you've driven here.
There are the aggressive drivers and the incomprehensible roads that twist hither and yon. 
Streets change names, sometimes in the middle of a block. The nice grandmother you met at
the museum will cut you off at the exit of the parking lot if you aren't riding the bumper
of the car in front of you. I'm quite certain it's an aspect of living so close together and 
nothing personal. I see the same driving in San Francisco and Boston and there I suspect 
it's quite deliberate.

<p>Being away from 4G data coverage has been a bit of a eye-opener. They have 4G coverage 
here, but since we are roaming, we have to manage our access. Jackie and I bought 300MB 
plans for ourselves and 120MB for the kids along with phone and SMS. For the four of us for 
the trip, that cost us about $200, which isn't too bad. However, leaving the phone on for
one night without paying attention could eat all that data up, so we had to get all the 
settings on our phones correct before leaving. I turn on 4G when I absolutely need it and 
then turn it off again.

<p>The biggest issue has been the lack of Google Maps and the ability to search online
wherever we happen to be. Google Maps has a way to cache their maps for small sections
offline, but it's really badly done and not worth the effort.

<p>Fortunately, there's a solution and a pretty good one at that. Better yet, it's free.
The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target=_blank">Open Street Map</a> project
has map data in great detail and it's all accessible without charge. Companies use the
data and there are tools to customize the data and convert to different formats. 

<p>Think of OpenStreetMap as the Wikipedia for maps because anyone can edit it. In fact, if you 
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/185101"target=_blank">look around Hydro</a>
you will see some of the work I did. As the school has built buildings and City Hall has
moved, I edited those things. I also correctly placed most of the churches and removed some
roads that are no longer in service. This actually benefits the people in our community as
the maps that Apple uses in the iPhone are based on the OpenStreetMap data.

<p>I paid $5 for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">an app</a> 
on my Android phone that has custom versions of these maps suited to driving and navigating. 
There is a free version of the app as well, but I was happy to pay the authors to have 
quality map data stored on my phone so I didn't have to rely on 4G networks. 

<p>Jackie has been the navigator on this trip. After a bit of a learning curve, she was
able to use Osmand on my phone to locate places we are traveling to and give me accurate
turn-by-turn directions. The car we rented has a built-in navigation system, but the
information on the phone is better and more easily accessible. The thing Jackie especially
likes is the OpenStreetMap data tells us which lane to be in to make a proper turn. Even
Google Maps doesn't do this very well.

<p>The only problem with using OpenStreetMap is it hasn't been sufficiently "dumbed down"
to allow non-technical consumers to use it. Apple has done a pretty good job, but if you
remember when Apple Maps first came out, it got a lot of bad press and the stories of
drivers doing stupid things with the data made the news often. It's better now, but there's
a lot more that could be done by a company that wanted to invest in making it a usable
consumer product.

<p>Alright, that's enough on that...

<p>...

<p>We made it to Bastogne easily enough. We stopped along the way to get petrol and this
is the one place where the strength of the US dollar hasn't helped us one bit. To put 8 gallons
of gasoline in our car cost roughly $53. Gas is priced by the liter and I put €50 worth in
the tank. It didn't quite fill it up from the 3/8 mark.

<p>The Bastogne War Museum is a modern building set amid the beautiful rolling hills of
the Belgian countryside. There is a 3 story granite monument next to the museum that 
dominates the site.

<p>The museum walk-through sets up the political situation in Europe that led to the outbreak
of World War II. As the museum is in Belgium, some of the narrative is about events in 
Belgium specifically that we never learn about in the States. However, it's important to
understand why the country capitulated to the Nazis so fast, which led to the overrun of
France only a few months later. Had Belgium held firm, Great Britain and France might've 
had time to properly defend the rest of the continent from the onslaught.

<p>As the tour progressed, we listened to stories in voices as if they were narrating events
in real time. We heard a schoolboy, a young school teacher, an 18-year old American soldier
from Georgia, and a German lieutenant. At each juncture, their stories change to reflect
the dominance of the German army and then their retreat after D-Day. The story culminates
in a theatre with some lighting and sound effects to give viewers the feeling like they were
in those woods, freezing to death and eating tree bark for nourishment.

<p>I'll seque out and mention that if you haven't seen <i>Band of Brothers</i>,
you really should. It's a great series and it follows a unit of the 101st Airborne from their
training to the end of the war. It's on Netflix and you can probably find it on HBO Go if 
you're a subscriber. Speaking of band of brothers, 
<a href="https://youtu.be/A-yZNMWFqvM" target="_blank">here is Kenneth Branagh</a> 
as Henry V, doing the monologue that gives us the phrase.

<p>During the culmination of the tour, we find the four narrators all in the same place.
The German officer was wounded and captured by the American soldier. The young boy and
his teacher were sheltered in the basement of a restaurant as the shelling hits its' 
finale. The soldiers, walking through town to the US headquarters duck into the basement
with the others and enjoy their first meal in three days.

<p>The last part of the tour brings you to how the narrators lives were changed by the war.
The German soldier returned to Germany but escaped the Russian influence zone that eventually
became East Germany. He became a respected member of the West German parliament and lived
to see German Reunification. The American soldier lived a long life, as did the teacher.
The young boy was still alive as of last year and still runs his fathers' bicycle shop in
the town of Bastogne.

<p>As you leave the museum, you're faced with the monument. Elijah and I both walked out 
at the same time, into bright sunlight. We saw the monument for the first time, almost as
you see here. We both let out "huh, wow" at the same time. Perhaps it's not so obvious
here, but if you click on the picture to the right, you might understand.

<p>The "crypt" under the Bastogne War Museum has a chamber dedicated to when the memorial
was created in 1950. There were some fresh flowers in there as well as some notes written
and special items left by visitors, perhaps with their grandfather in tow. It's a somber
place, but not without some life. The view from the side of the monument is beautiful.

<p>We didn't know if we would see any veterans at the museum. Those young men, what few 
remain, are in their 90's now. We lost my uncle Ernest, who was wounded at Normandy, two 
summers ago. He never talked about his experience there in my presence, but he was quite
the talkative old fart in most every other subject and I miss him still. There were older
gentlemen around, mostly in their 70's, and none looked to be reliving the most horrific
moments of their young lives.

<p>...

<p>From Bastogne, we had a very pleasant hours drive to the city of Luxembourg in the
country of Luxembourg. We talked about what we saw in the museum and our ideas about how
the war went the way it did. The countryside in eastern Belgium is gorgeous.

<p>We crossed into Luxembourg to find an IKEA. Whadyaknow. The entire country could fit 
inside the county where we live, so it
didn't take too long to find our hotel on the outskirts of town. The hotel is a Best
Western, which at first gave me pause, but it turned out alright. It wasn't fancy, but
we've stayed in a lot worse. It was a 4 bed dorm room with a shared bathroom. We each
had our own bed in the same room, which we've come to expect on this trip. The room for 4
was €86 or about $95.

<p>We had a nice meal at a local restaurant. The waiters didn't speak much English but they
were friendly. We were able to get meals ordered for everyone and everything was great.
The one thing I'll mention is that I had a <i>Filet 
<a href="https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/du%20cheval" target=_blank">du Cheval</a></i>.
I ate every bite. We all had desserts--sorbet, creme brulee, and an apple tart and they
were all delicious.

<p>Everyone crashed about 10:30 PM. Early for this trip, but Friday we're heading toward
Paris after some sightseeing around Luxembourg. A short day, walking wise, with only 6,700
steps, but long on discovery.
