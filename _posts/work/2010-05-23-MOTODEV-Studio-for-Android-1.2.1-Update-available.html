		<p>The MOTODEV group had a great time at Google I/O last week and it was fun meeting many of you at our booth, during the sessions, and at the after-hours MOTOBOWL event. We hope that those of you who attended also had a great time.
		<p> 
		<p>On Thursday, after the Android announcements during the keynote session, Google released the 2.2 (Froyo) SDK. In order to use this SDK with Eclipse or MOTODEV Studio, you will need a newer version of the Android Development Tools plugins, version 0.9.7. MOTODEV Studio Update 1.2.1 has these plugins as well as a few new features and a number of bug fixes that we've put in place since version 1.2 was released in March.
		<p>
		<p>The install guide, release notes and online help have the full story, but here are some highlights:
		<ul>
		<li>Supports Android Tools r6 (i.e. Froyo and earlier)
		<li>The MOTODEV Studio plugins are available as an archive package, so you can install into an existing Eclipse installation without having access to the Internet
		<li>The Startup Options property dialog now helps you calculate screen resolution and scale values based upon the screen dimensions of your monitor and the device being emulated
		<li>The Device Management view now displays the Android target for emulated devices, not just for connected ones
		<li>The Device Properties dialog now has a CSV Export option that lets you save handset properties
		<li>You can now refresh local databases to reflect changes in remote data without having to disconnect and reconnect
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Some things to remember</strong>
		<p>There are some known issues with the release.
		<p>If you received a USB flash drive from us at Google I/O or MOTOBOWL, you should not use the 1.2.1 update on the flash drive. We created that image in the anticipation of Google's SDK release but without the details of how it would be distributed. The Froyo SDK now has the samples as a separate installation, which required our engineering team to make a slight change to the workings of the New Project wizard. Please update from the online site or use the separate 1.2.1 archive file from the download page.
		<p>The new SDK release from Google actually updates all the previous platform releases for 1.5, 1.6, and 2.1. If you are taking advantage of features specific to these releases, you will also need to download those platforms using the SDK updater from Google.
		<p>In order to get this update out quickly (only 1 day after Google), the engineering and test teams had to make some practical decisions. The product was tested thoroughly using the code that was checked into kernel.org several weeks ago. However, there may be situations in the SDK itself where problems may arise. When the SDK was released, we restarted our testing, but primarily on Windows. We knew you would be anxious to get started on your own development and deliberately bypassed the full test regimen. So, if you find problems, let us know with a post in the MOTODEV Studio Discussion Boards and we'll fix them in the shortest time frame that we can manage or at least try to find a suitable workaround.
		<p>Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio for Android.
