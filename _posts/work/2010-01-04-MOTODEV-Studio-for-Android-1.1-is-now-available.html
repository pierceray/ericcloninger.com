		<p>Hello Everyone,
		<p>I hope that 2010 is shaping up to be a great year for everyone. While everyone was enjoying a few days rest, the MOTODEV elves were busily working to make Android development even easier. I'm pleased to announce that MOTODEV Studio 1.1 is now available for download.
		<p>MOTODEV Studio for Android 1.1 supports the Android 2.0.1 SDK and includes the ADT 0.9.5 plugins. The 1.1 version is only available as a full download and not as an update. You should uninstall any previous versions of MOTODEV Studio for Android prior to installing the latest version. Release notes, installation instructions, and the installer are available on the MOTODEV download site.
		<p>The changes to MOTODEV Studio for Android version 1.1 are twofold. First, we wanted to roll up the bug fixes that we've made since October. We're also beginning to provide support for the Ophone 1.5 (Beta) SDK and JIL Widget SDK. If you plan to develop applications for either of these SDKs, you should read the installation instructions to understand the correct way(s) to install them as they are different from the Android SDK installation.
		<p><strong>Android 2.0.1 SDK</strong>
		<p>The ADT 0.9.5 plugins have a new mechanism for installing the Android SDK from prior versions. After installing MOTODEV Studio 1.1, you will need to use "Window->Android SDK and AVD Manager" to find and install the 2.0.1 SDK from Google's site. This is different from previous versions of MOTODEV Studio. 
		<p>If you have any problems with the update or other questions or comments about MOTODEV Studio for Android, please post your feedback in the MOTODEV Studio Discussion board.
		<p>Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio for Android.
