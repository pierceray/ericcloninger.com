**Welcome to EricCloninger.com**

This site is where I keep my personal blog posts as well as a historical record of the 
updates, white papers, and presentations that I've created for my employers for the 
last 15 years (or so). Where possible, I link to the external source for my writing, but
as companies shut down websites, I link to a mirror copy on my own server.

I created this site using the [Jekyll static site generator](https://www.jekyllrb.com) with
the [Voyager theme](https://github.com/redVi/voyager), customized for my own needs. The 
[photo gallery](http://photo.ericcloninger.com) is created using a customizable static site generator called 
[Sigal](https://github.com/saimn/sigal). All files are stored and available on Amazon's
S3 hosting service. 

All the photos on this site are original compositions. I shoot primarily with Pentax
digital camera equipment with a variety of lenses and lighting adapters. Like most
photographers, I'm not satisfied with any of my equipment.

This site links to an interactive version of my resume that was built using
Bootstrap 3. You can access [that site here](http://portfolio.ericcloninger.com) or by
using the navigation bar at the top. If you are looking for a 
[printable copy of my resume](http://portfolio.ericcloninger.com/Eric_Cloninger_Resume.pdf), 
you can find it here.

Thank you for stopping by.
